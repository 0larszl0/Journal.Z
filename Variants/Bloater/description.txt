Suggested by the name, this zombie tends to look inflated or largely deformed. They are not the fastest of zombies but
have a volatile body. Their explosive power is determined by the fragility of their body. So, bloaters that require
only a slight puncture to the body, whether it be from a gunshot or stabwound, will pop like a balloon with minimal force
and chance of infection. However, those that are of a more stable, and usually of a more abominable structure, have a
more ferocious blast and chance of infection-- regardless of the protective gear you may be wearing.
