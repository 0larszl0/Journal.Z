In study, it has found that the longer these kinds of zombies are alive whilst being exposed to new knowledge that they
accumulate, the more dangerous may become.
Consider a captured Einstein. If they were trained and exposed to swordsmanship, similarly to humans, they will begin
to gain proficiencies within that skill.
However, it is important to note, this learning process is not really "learning", but rather to memorise and mimic
visual cues of whom it saw it from. Consequently, and via my own tests, having it learn textually or verbally is as
useless as teaching a baby the fundamentals of mathematics.
