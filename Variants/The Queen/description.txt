Unlike a Screamer that utilises sound to attract any zombie to a particular location, queens (or kings), can communicate to
zombies in some form to establish order and to execute commands. Depending on the intelligence of the queen can one determine
the threat of these variants; it's quite obvious to realise the smarter the intellect of the queen the greater the danger
any survivor or band, or even organisations of survivors will have.
